sigh sappy letter incoming 😅<br><br>
I don't even know what I want to say so I'm just gonna go with the flow,
First of all, I hope you liked the website :3, despite it being the most simplest one ever, It was the best I could do and I put a lot of time and effort into it to try and make it look sort of presentable. You have NO idea about how much my mood lightens up whenever you text, cuz you're one of the best person I could talk comfortably with. I literally tell yoy everything😏🙄, and it just genuinely makes me happy to just be with you even if you're in a whole other continent, not gonna lie I did doubt us in the beginning, but once everything was going well, It was really reassuring, And we're already 4months in?? LIKE WTH ITS GONNA BE 5 MONTHS IN ANOTHER 10 DAYS. You're such a sweet guy and I'm so fucking glad I confessed to you even though I was sharting my pants during that very moment, and i literally remember EVERY single detail after that, like all our deep conversations, you talking about rowing and what not, AND THE FIRST TIME YOU SAID YOU LOVE ME?? OKAY DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED IM KICKING MY FEETSIES RN THINKING ABOUT THAT NIGHT, and everything else that followed which eventually lead to what we have today 😝. I've genuinely gotten so comfortable with you its CRAZY, I used to shit my pants every time i sent you a picture worrying about if the angle was right😔, and now i lirerally DONT give a gaf. I felt like such a bum thinking about how I could basically do nothing special for your birthday BUT THEN I GOT THE AMAZEBALL IDEA TO MAKE YOU A SHITTY WEBSITE!! 😘. So I hope yoy like it and thank you for staying throughout this sappy letter, 😘😘😘.

With love and farts,
